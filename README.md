## Introduction

LudoGL is built with a focus on advanced rendering techniques. It supports features like bloom, deferred rendering, and screen-space reflections, providing developers with the tools they need to create immersive 3D experiences. Whether you are developing a game or a visual application, LudoGL aims to simplify the rendering process while maximizing performance.

## Features

- **Bloom**: Enhance the brightness of bright areas to create a glowing effect.
- **Deferred Rendering**: Efficiently handle complex scenes by separating geometry and lighting passes.
- **FXAA**: Apply fast approximate anti-aliasing to reduce jagged edges.
- **GBuffer**: Store multiple rendering outputs in a single pass for improved performance.
- **GTao**: Implement ground truth ambient occlusion for realistic shading.
- **Motion Blur**: Add a sense of speed and realism to moving objects.
- **Screen Space Reflections (SSR)**: Reflect the environment accurately on surfaces.
- **Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)**: Smooth out edges over time for a polished look.

## Getting Started

To start using LudoGL, you need to have a basic understanding of WebGL2. This renderer is specifically designed for modern browsers that support WebGL2 features. 

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports WebGL2.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML.
- A local server setup (optional, but recommended for testing).

## Installation

You can download the latest version of LudoGL from the [Releases section](https://github.com/azhar440/LudoGL/releases). Simply choose the appropriate file, download it, and execute it in your local environment.

### Steps to Install

1. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/azhar440/LudoGL/releases).
2. Download the latest release file.
3. Unzip the file to your desired location.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see LudoGL in action.

## Usage

To use LudoGL in your project, include the LudoGL script in your HTML file. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>LudoGL Example</title>
    <script src="path/to/ludogl.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
    <script>
        const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
        const gl = canvas.getContext('webgl2');
        // Initialize LudoGL here
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set up LudoGL:

```javascript
// Initialize the LudoGL renderer
const renderer = new LudoGL.Renderer(canvas);

// Set up your scene
const scene = new LudoGL.Scene();

// Add objects to your scene
scene.add(new LudoGL.Mesh(geometry, material));

// Render loop
function render() {
    renderer.render(scene);
    requestAnimationFrame(render);
}

render();
```
